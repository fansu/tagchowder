# TagChowder
Parsing and extracting information from (possibly malformed) HTML/XML documents

                        TagChowder - Just Keep On Truckin'

### Introduction

TagChowder is a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that, instead of parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as it is found in the wild: poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from short. TagChowder is designed for people who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a rational application design. By providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied to even the worst HTML. TagSoup also includes a command-line processor that reads HTML files and can generate either clean HTML or well-formed XML that is a close approximation to XHTML.

This is also the README file packaged with TagChowder.

TagChowder is free and Open Source software licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, see LICENSE files for more details.

TagChowder is a fork from TagSoup library by John Cowan version 1.2.1.

## What TagSoup does

TagChowder is designed as a parser, not a whole application; it isn't intended to permanently clean up bad HTML, as HTML Tidy does, only to parse it on the fly. Therefore, it does not convert presentation HTML to CSS or anything similar. It does guarantee well-structured results: tags will wind up properly nested, default attributes will appear appropriately, and so on.

The semantics of TagChowder are as far as practical those of actual HTML browsers. In particular, never, never will it throw any sort of syntax error: the TagChowder motto is "Just Keep On Truckin'". But there's much, much more. For example, if the first tag is LI, it will supply the application with enclosing HTML, BODY, and UL tags. Why UL? Because that's what browsers assume in this situation. For the same reason, overlapping tags are correctly restarted whenever possible: text like:

This is <B>bold, <I>bold italic, </b>italic, </i>normal text
gets correctly rewritten as:

This is <b>bold, <i>bold italic, </i></b><i>italic, </i>normal text.
By intention, TagChowder is small and fast. It does not depend on the existence of any framework other than SAX, and should be able to work with any framework that can accept SAX parsers. In particular, XOM is known to work.

You can replace the low-level HTML scanner with one based on Sean McGrath's PYX format (very close to James Clark's ESIS format). You can also supply an AutoDetector that peeks at the incoming byte stream and guesses a character encoding for it. Otherwise, the platform default is used. If you need an autodetector of character sets, consider trying to adapt the Mozilla one; if you succeed, let me know.

### TagChowder 2.0.0 released

TagChowder 2.0.0 is a modernization release, it includes all features available on tagsoup 1.2.1. The goal of this project is to keep updating the code with small fixes and features. This project requires unit tests and code coverage by default, and uses github and a automated pipe-line to publish new versions in a automated fashion for every commit that is merged, without humans need for each release.

 - The default content model for bogons (unknown elements) is ANY rather than EMPTY. This is a breaking change. It can be undone on the command line with the --emptybogons switch, or programmatically with parser.setFeature(Parser.emptyBogonsFeature, true).

 - The processing of entity references in attribute values has finally been fixed to do what browsers do. That is, a reference is only recognized if it is properly terminated by a semicolon; otherwise it is treated as plain text. This means that URIs like foo?cdown=32&cup=42 are no longer seen as containing an instance of the âˆª character (whose name happens to be cup).

 - Several new switches have been added:

   --doctype-system and --doctype-public force a DOCTYPE declaration to be output and allow setting the system and public identifiers.

   --standalone and --version allow control of the XML declaration that is output. (Note that the XML output is always version 1.0, even if you use --version=1.1.)

   --norootbogons causes unknown elements not to be allowed as the document root element. Instead, they are made children of the default root element (the html element for HTML).

 - The TagChowder core supports character entities with values above U+FFFF. As a consequence, the HTML schema now supports all 2,210 standard character entities from the 2007-12-14 draft of XML Entity Definitions for Characters, except the 94 which require more than one Unicode character to represent.

 - A number of content models have been loosened to allow elements to appear in new and non-standard (but commonly found) places. In particular, tables are allowed inside paragraphs, against the letter of the W3C specification. Since the span element is intended for fine control of appearance using CSS, it should never have been a restartable element. This very long-standing bug has now been fixed.

 - The following non-standard elements are partly supported: bgsound, blink, canvas, comment, listing, marquee, nobr, rbc, rb, rp, rtc, rt, ruby, wbr, xmp.

 - In HTML output mode, boolean attributes like checked are output as such, rather than in XML style as checked="checked".

 - Runs of < characters such as << and <<< are handled correctly in text rather than being transformed into extremely bogus start-tags.


Here is a detailed list of the features:
 - DOCTYPE is now recognized even in lower case.
 - We make sure to buffer the reader, eliminating a long-standing bug that would crash on certain inputs, such as & followed by CR+LF.
 - The HTML scanner's table is precompiled at run time for efficiency, causing a 4x speedup on large input documents.
 - ]] within a CDATA section no longer causes input to be discarded.
 - Remove bogus newline after printing children of the root element.
 - Allow the noscript element anywhere, the same as the script element.
 - Updated to the 2011 edition of the W3C character entity list.
 - Match DOCTYPE case-blind
 - Extend PushbackReader's size for oddball cases like & followed by CR

### TagChowder as a stand-alone program

It is possible to run TagChowder as a program by saying java -jar tagchowder.jar [option ...] [file ...]. Files mentioned on the command line will be parsed individually. If no files are specified, the standard input is read.

The following options are understood:

--files
Output into individual files, with html extensions changed to xhtml. Otherwise, all output is sent to the standard output.
--html
Output is in clean HTML: the XML declaration is suppressed, as are end-tags for the known empty elements.
--omit-xml-declaration
The XML declaration is suppressed.
--method=html
End-tags for the known empty HTML elements are suppressed.
--doctype-system=systemid
Forces the output of a DOCTYPE declaration with the specified systemid.
--doctype-public=publicid
Forces the output of a DOCTYPE declaration with the specified publicid.
--version=version
Sets the version string in the XML declaration.
--standalone=[yes|no]
Sets the standalone declaration to yes or no.
--pyx
Output is in PYX format.
--pyxin
Input is in PYXoid format (need not be well-formed).
--nons
Namespaces are suppressed. Normally, all elements are in the XHTML 1.x namespace, and all attributes are in no namespace.
--nobogons
Bogons (unknown elements) are suppressed.
--nodefaults
Default attribute values are suppressed.
--nocolons
Explicit colons in element and attribute names are changed to underscores.
--norestart
don't restart any normally restartable elements.
--ignorable
Output whitespace in elements with element-only content.
--emptybogons
Bogons are given a content model of EMPTY rather than ANY.
--any
Bogons are given a content model of ANY rather than EMPTY (default).
--norootbogons
Bogons are not allowed to be root elements; make them subordinate to the root.
--lexical
Pass through HTML comments and DOCTYPE declarations. Has no effect when output is in PYX format.
--reuse
Reuse a single instance of TagSoup parser throughout. Normally, a new one is instantiated for each input file.
--nocdata
Change the content models of the script and style elements to treat them as ordinary #PCDATA (text-only) elements, as in XHTML, rather than with the special CDATA content model.
--encoding=encoding
Specify the input encoding. The default is the Java platform default.
--output-encoding=encoding
Specify the output encoding. The default is the Java platform default.
--help
Print help.
--version
Print the version number.

### SAX features and properties

TagChowder supports the following SAX features in addition to the standard ones:

http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/ignore-bogons
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will ignore unknown elements.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/bogons-empty
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will give unknown elements a content model of EMPTY; a value of "false", a content model of ANY.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/root-bogons
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will allow unknown elements to be the root of the output document.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/default-attributes
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will return default attribute values for missing attributes that have default values.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/translate-colons
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will translate colons into underscores in names.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/restart-elements
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will attempt to restart the restartable elements.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/ignorable-whitespace
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will transmit whitespace in element-only content via the SAX ignorableWhitespace callback. Normally this is not done, because HTML is an SGML application and SGML suppresses such whitespace.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/cdata-elements
A value of "true" indicates that the parser will process the script and style elements (or any elements with type='cdata' in the TSSL schema) as SGML CDATA elements (that is, no markup is recognized except the matching end-tag).
TagSoup supports the following SAX properties in addition to the standard ones:

http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/properties/scanner
Specifies the Scanner object this parser uses.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/properties/schema
Specifies the Schema object this parser uses.
http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/properties/auto-detector
Specifies the AutoDetector (for encoding detection) this parser uses.

### The TSaxon XSLT-for-HTML processor

I am also distributing TSaxon, a repackaging of version 6.5.5 of Michael Kay's Saxon XSLT version 1.0 implementation that includes TagSoup. TSaxon is a drop-in replacement for Saxon, and can be used to process either HTML or XML documents with XSLT stylesheets.

### Other TagChowder and related things

TagChoder is a fork from Tagsoup 1.2.1 java implementattion. TagChowder not only lexes its input it also attempts to balance tags in the style of TagSoup 1.2.1.

BeautifulSoup is closer to my TagSoup, but is written in Python and returns a parse tree. I believe its heuristics are hard-coded for HTML. There is a port to Ruby called RubyfulSoup.

There are a variety of other HTML SAX parsers written in Java, jsoup, notably NekoHTML, JTidy (a port of the C library and tool HTML Tidy), and HTML Parser. All have their good and bad points: the general view around the Web seems to be that TagChowder is the slowest, but also the most robust and reliable.

Finally, there is a full port of my TagSoup to C++, but unfortunately it is currently trapped inside IBM. The process to release it as Open Source is under way, and I hope to feature it here some time soon.
